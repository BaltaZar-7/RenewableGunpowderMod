# RenewableGunpowderMod
Adds gunpowder materials: Dusting Sulfur, Stump Remover and Lead to loot pools via beachcombing.  
# Description
First, I wanted to make a Trader pool mod, but that is out of my league. So I went for beachcombing.  
Adds the above 3 raw materials to loottables and beachcombing tables.  
Comes with modsettings configuration for custom spawn chances.
The chances works as follows: The chances are percentages (%), and for each invidual beachcombing spawn place. If you set each of the 3 items' spawn chance to 33.3% no vanilla item will spawn there. If you set 1% for only one item, you will have 1% chance to spawn the item, and 99% to spawn vanilla item. There are quite a few spawning points, so I advise to use low numbers. I use 0.5%.  
There is also a modcomponent file, which adds these 3 materials to some container loot tables, such as toolbox loot table.
# Installation
Download and install dependancy mods AND its dependancies: ModSettings, ModComponent
Download and place the dll file into your \Mods folder.  
Download and place the modcomponent file into your \Mods folder.  
These two files can work seperately, so you can install just one of them.  
Launch the game, and go into modsettings, and change the values to your liking. Can edit the json file generated with the mod for more precise setting.
